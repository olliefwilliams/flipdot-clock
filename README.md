# flipdot-clock

A wall clock made from a flipdot display from an old bus, controlled by an ESP-32 Microcontroller connected to a custom driver board.

98% of this work was done by [themainframe](https://github.com/themainframe) in his repository: [`esp32-flipdot-controller`](https://github.com/themainframe/esp32-flipdot-controller).

Network time-fetching code taken from the [SNTP example directory](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/release/v3.3/examples/protocols/sntp/main/sntp_example_main.c) in an old version (3.3) of Espressif's [`esp-idf`](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) repo.
